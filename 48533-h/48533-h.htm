<span class="i2">Such grief, that they could see no more. The heart&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That quick'ning pulse of nations&mdash;could not bear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Another throb of pain, and could not hear<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Another cry of tortur'd motherhood.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Those uncomplaining lips, they sob no more<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The soundless sobs of dark and burning tears,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That none have seen; they smile no more, to breathe<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A mother's comfort into aching hearts.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_2" id="Page_2">{2}</a></span>
<span class="i2">The patriarchal Queen, the monument<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of touching widowhood, of endless love,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And childlike purity&mdash;she sleeps. This night<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is watchful not. The restless hand, that slave<br /></span>
<span class="i2">To duty, to a mastermind, to wisdom<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That fathom'd history and saw beyond<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The times, lies still in marble whiteness. Love<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So great, so faithful, unforgetting and<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unselfish&mdash;must it sleep? Or will that veil,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That widow's veil unfold, and spread into<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The dovelike wings, that long were wont to hover<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In anxious care about her world-wide nest,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And now will soar and sing, as harpchords sing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whilst in their upward flight they breast the wind<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Destiny. No rest for her, no tomb,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor ashes! Light eternal! Hymns of joy!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No silence now for her, who, ever silent,<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_3" id="Page_3">{3}</a></span>
<span class="i2">Above misfortunes' storms and thund'ring billows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Would stand with clear and fearless brow, so calm,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That men drew strength from out those dauntless eyes,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And quiet from that hotly beating heart,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Kept still by stern command and unbent will<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beneath those tight shut lips. Not ashes, where<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A beacon e'er will burn, a fire, like<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The Altar's Soma, for the strong, the weak,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The true, the brave, and for the quailing. No,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Not ashes, but a light, that o'er the times<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Will shed a gentle ray, and show the haven,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">When all the world, stormshaken, rudderless, will pray:<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If but her century would shine again!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Oh, Lord! Why hast thou ta'en thy peaceful Queen?<br /></span>

<span class="i2">So quiet, that it cannot hurt.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">The pangs<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Nor breathless uphill work, nor heavy with<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_5" id="Page_5">{5}</a></span>
<span class="i2">The brewing tempests, which have torn away<br /></span>
<span class="i2">So much, that nothing more remains to fear.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">What once was hope, is gone. You know. You saw<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The worst, and not a sigh is left of all<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The heavy sighs that tore your heart, and not<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A tear of all those tears that burnt your cheeks,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And ploughed the furrows into them.<br /></span>
<span class="i32">You see<br /></span>
<span class="i2">How others work again and weep again,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hope and fear. Thy alabaster room<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With marble floor and dainty hangings has<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A look so still, that others wonder why<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They feel it churchlike. All thy life is here;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy life hath built the vault and paved it, and<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy hands have woven yonder curtains that<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Is feeble not to thee, as all thy wishes<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are silent and demand no effort. Age<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is kind to thee, allows thee all the rest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That never came, when life was hard and toilsome.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Receive it with a smile and clothe thyself<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In white, in Nature's silver crown, and sing<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A lullaby of promise and of comfort.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Tell them that life is precious, after work,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And after grief and after all the deaths,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And not a loathsome burden of a life.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Old age is like a room of alabaster,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The curtains silken; thou art priest and Druid!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">No mystery for thee, but Light from heaven!<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Us never yet a ray of satisfaction,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Nor of real joy, the bleeding conqueror.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And hope is e'er the same. It dwelleth not<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In hearts that are too great for hope, too great<br /></span>

<span class="i2">"Behold! 'tis dust and ashes!"&mdash;though it scatter<br /></span>

<span class="i2">Serves as a force to send thee ever higher,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Far above yawning gulf and raging whirlpool.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">O heart of mine, be strong! Doubt not, for doubt<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Was ever the one deadly foe, whose toils<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Might strangle thee. Up! fight that monster, trample<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Its venom under foot. The hour has come<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_65" id="Page_65">{65}</a></span>
<span class="i2">For thee to step forth, young again and free,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A new Sir Galahad, brave, pure and strong,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Around whom angels hover as he stretches<br /></span>
<span class="i2">His spotless shield to meet the early rays<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><span class="dropcap">T</span>HY sadness is a leaden shroud, a rock<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Of Sisyphus, which thou must upward roll<br /></span>
<span class="i2">By night and day, on, on. Its downward rush<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is no relief, no help, since it but seems<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Heavier at each fresh start. And still thy strength<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Is waning, and thy heart aches with the tears&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The unshed tears that lie like stones upon it,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">While those that flowed are rivers in thy path&mdash;<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Unfathomable, fordless, dark and deep.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">These thou must wade, with all thy burdens&mdash;wade<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_67" id="Page_67">{67}</a></span>
<span class="i2">And sink with every step as 'twere thy last,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And feel such deadly weakness seize on thee<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As though some raging fever laid thee low.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thy sadness is a Nessus robe, that clings<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In burning folds about thee, sears thy flesh,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And eats into thy bones. 'Tis like a weapon<br /></span>
<span class="i2">A man turns on himself, whose wound nought heals,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Since it is dealt against his inmost soul.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">If, then, through clouds of sadness, thou perceivest<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The world, well mayst thou say of it: 'Tis hell!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">For spring itself is dark, the birds' sweet carol<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cheerless and dull, thy life a very desert,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Where human faces pass like spectral visions,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And gladness is a thing so clean forgotten,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As if it ne'er had been&mdash;its very name<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Become a soundless word, a ghostly whisper!<br /></span>

<span class="i2"><span class="dropcap">B</span>E still! A corpse lies there, a poor dead thing,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With upturned face, white-lipped, the haggard features,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Whereon once played a smile that gladdened hearts,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Now set and cold. Circled with black and sunken<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Are now the eyes where stars were wont to sparkle,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And Fate has drawn deep lines between the brows,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">That but a short time since seemed arched for mischief,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And full of childish mirth. Close to the temples<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_69" id="Page_69">{69}</a></span>
<span class="i2">The hair clings straight and dull and colourless.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And it was golden once, like living rays,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And waved about the head, a sunrise-halo!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The hands are folded&mdash;rigid, waxen, cold,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">They that were once like rose-leaves, in whose veins<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The blood coursed swiftly, full of generous warmth<br /></span>
<span class="i2">And loving gifts, and flowers, and balm for sorrow.<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Cold are they now, as had they never yet<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Clasped children to the heart, nor with deft touch<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Broidered such fairy work, nor scattered broadcast<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Such fairy gifts. The feet that danced along,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Leaving no trace upon the flower-petals,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Lie stiff out-stretched, and round about them hang<br /></span>
<span class="i2">In heavy folds, as were they carved in marble,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The robes that fluttered lightly in the breeze,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Like opalescent wings.<br /></span><span class="pagenum"><a name="Page_70" id="Page_70">{70}</a></span>
<span class="i24">Ah! cold and dark<br /></span>
<span class="i2">The grave to thee, thou Sun-child! ray of brightness!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Beloved messenger of God! Arise!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Canst thou be dead? and canst thou look so stern?<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Ah, no! not stern, but martyred! Cruel hands<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Have rent thy garments, dragged thee by the hair,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Burnt out thine eyes, and filled thy cup with poison,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">As fit requital of thy priceless gifts,<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Kind Joy, true friend! And now they see thee dead<br /></span>
<span class="i2">With careless eyes, and point, and feign to think<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Thou ne'er hast been! Ah, Joy! sweet Joy! arise!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Be stronger than thy foes! But no! 'tis vain!<br /></span>
<span class="i2">Poor Joy was deadly tired, and now she sleeps!<br /></span>
